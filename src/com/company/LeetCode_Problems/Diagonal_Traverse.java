// Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order

// ------------- Points to be noted --------------------------------
// (1) The first row and the last column in this problem would serve as the starting point for the corresponding diagonal.
// (2) For going up in the diagonal => [i, j] = [i-1, j+1]
// (3) For going down in the diagonal => [i, j] = [i+1, j-1]

// -------------------- Important Points -----------------------------
// (1) Direction of the diagonal
// => We can simply use a boolean variable and keep alternating it to figure out the direction for a diagonal.

// (2) Next head of the diagonal depending upon its direction
// => The good part is, we already know the end of the previous diagonal. We can use that information to figure out
// the head of the next diagonal.

// ------------ Next Head when going UP ----------------
// For going upward the head lie below the downward diagonal's tail
// if tail lies in last row then the head will be present right next to the tail

// ------------- Next Head when going DOWN -----------------------------
// For going downward the head lie right next to the upward diagonal's tail
// if tail lies in the last column then the head will be present below the tail

// -------------------------------------------- ALGORITHM -------------------------------------------------
// (1) Initialize a boolean variable called direction which will tell us whether the current diagonal is an upwards or downwards going.
//     Based on the current direction and the tail, we will determine the head of the next diagonal. Initially the
//     direction would be 1 which would indicate up. We will keep alternating this value from one iteration to the next.

// (2) Assuming we know the head of a diagonal, say matrix[i][j], we will use the direction to progress along the diagonal and process its elements.
//     For an upwards going diagonal, the next element in the diagonal would be matrix[i - 1][j + 1]
//     For a downwards going diagonal, the next element would be matrix[i + 1][j âˆ’ 1].

// (3) We keep processing the elements of the current diagonal until we go out of the boundaries of the matrix.

// (4) Now, given that we know the tail of the diagonal (the last node before we went out of bounds), let's see how we can find the next head.
//     Note that in the following pseudocode, the direction is for the current diagonal and we are trying to find the
//     head of the next diagonal. So, if the direction is up, it means the next diagonal would be going down and
//     vice-versa.

//     tail = [i, j]
//     if direction == up, then {
//        if [i, j + 1] is within bounds, then {
//           next_head = [i, j + 1]
//        } else {
//          next_head = [i + 1, j]
//       }
//    } else {
//         if [i + 1, j] is within bounds, then {
//              next_head = [i + 1, j]
//         } else {
//              next_head = [i, j + 1]
//         }
//    }
